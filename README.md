# French-gender-game

A small package to help English-speakers practice genders for French nouns.
This is still a work in progress! I'm going through the words and trying to correct whatever I find
but if you know something is incorrect please create an issue.

```node
npm install -g french-gender-game
```

### To play

Start a game with:

```node
french-gender-game start
```

or with the infinite option:

```node
french-gender-game start --inf
```

If you haven't chosen infinite mode you can chose how many words in a round before the game starts.

Pick masculine or feminine. The game will tell you if you were correct and show the rule that determines the gender. Some are based on the last sound or spelling and some are categorical (most trees are masculine, for example).
